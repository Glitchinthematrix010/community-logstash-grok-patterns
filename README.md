# Logstash Grok Patterns, From You!

A collection of Grok patterns for Logstash, from the Community.

PRs are *very* welcome.

## Using the patterns

To add these patterns to your config, either

1. Put them into a file and use the [`patterns_dir`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html#plugins-filters-grok-patterns_dir) directive
2. Use the [`match`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html#plugins-filters-grok-match) directive

Also see the [core grok patterns](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/tree/master/patterns) in the Logstash repo.
